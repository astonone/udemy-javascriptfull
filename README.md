If this happens<br>return the user to the questions again<br><br>3) Use conditions to check personalMovieDB.count, and if it's less than 10 - print a message<br>"You've seen quite few movies", if it's between 10 and 30 - "You're a classic viewer", and if it's more -<br>"You're a film buff." And if it doesn't match any of the options - "There's been an error".<br><br>4) Practice and rewrite the loop in two other ways<br><br>Take the code from the previous homework assignment */                                                                                                                                                      |
| [practice3](https://github.com/astonone/udemy-javascriptfull/tree/master/practice3) | /* Assignment for the lesson:<br>1) Repeat the first part of the assignment from the lesson<br><br>2) Create a function showMyDB that will check the private property. If it is set to false - outputs the main object of the programme to the page<br><br>3) Create a function writeYourGenres in which the user will answer the question 3 times "Your favourite genre is number ${number in order}". Each answer is written to the data array genres */                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| [practice4](https://github.com/astonone/udemy-javascriptfull/tree/master/practice4) | /* Assignment for the lesson:<br>1) We already have a working application consisting of individual functions. Imagine that you have a task to rewrite it so that all functions become methods of the personalMovieDB object. This happens in real products when you change technologies or approach to programme architecture<br><br>2) Create a method toggleVisibleMyDB, which will check the privat property when called. If it is false - it switches it to true, if true - switches it to false. Test it together with showMyDB.<br><br>3) In the writeYourGenres method, forbid the user to click the "cancel" button or leave an empty string.<br>If he did - return him to the same question. After all genres are entered -<br>using the forEach method, output messages to the console in the following form:<br>"Favourite genre #(number in order starting from 1) is (name from array) "*/. |

It is in the img folder. Implement only with JS.<br>4) Generate a list of films on the page based on the data from this JS file. Sort them alphabetically.<br>5) Add numbering of the displayed films */                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
